# sqlalchemy-challenge
 A climate analysis was conducted to plan a vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii.

Python and SQLAlchemy (SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib) was used to do a basic analysis and exploration of the climate database. The previous 12 months of precipitation and temperature observation (TOBS) data and all of the stations were queried and visualized as a histogram. A Flask API was generated based on the above queries.
